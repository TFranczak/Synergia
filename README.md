Pictured above is the IOTA lattice. The current lattice file does not have an RF as depicted in the picture.
<H3> IOTA_Elens.py </H3>
IOTA simulation with an Electron lens lattice element. this is a simple lattice with no non linear elements besides the electron lens.

<H3> IOTA_opts.py </H3>
An options file containing parameters for the IOTA simulation. There are 3 main sections: beam options, simulation options, and electron lens options.
